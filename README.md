IMPRO Topic 5
We used the following tools in our project: 
Docker, MariaDB, PostgresDB, Inginx, 
We used TPC-H dataset to test our code. 

To run this project, First you need to downlaod the Webserver. (ex. Inginx) and connect this server to our files. 
You can write new queries to visulaiz now outputs, or you can switch between the excit outputs file, you need to change the file's name in the index.html file.
